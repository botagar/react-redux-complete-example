              ## Now let's setup our build system!
              (Skip this section if you are comfortable with basic webpack setup)  
              We'll be using Webpack and Babel to transpile and package our app  
                
              Create a file in the src directory called "webpack.config.js" then lets start with the following:
              ```
              var webpack = require('webpack')
              var path = require('path')

              var SRC = path.resolve(__dirname, 'src')

              }

              module.exports = config
              ```
              Note: "__dirname" is a nodejs variable returning the directory of the currently executing script
            </script>
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            <script type="text/template">
              Define an entry point and build output for our app
              ```
              var config = {
                entry: [
                  './src/main.js'
                ],
                output: {
                  path: DIST,
                  filename: 'app.bundle.js'
                }
              }
              ```

          <section data-markdown>
            <script type="text/template">
              At this stage, we can call webpack to (try) build stuff!  
              Add the build command to your config.json file
              ```
              "scripts": {
                "build": "webpack",
                "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
              }
              ```
              Now we can run the following command in the terminal
              ```
              yarn build
              ```
              This should create a new directory called "dist", and there should be a file "app.bundle.js"

              Let's start creating content.

              import React from 'react'

              There is an issue now. If you try build this, you will get an error.  
              This is because Webpack does not know how to handle this content.  
              We need a [Transpiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-to-source_compiler)! Good thing we installed [Babel](https://babeljs.io) ðŸ˜‰

              ```
              ReactDOM.render(

              ```
              Where "element" is the what we want do display (in our case, "<h1>hello world</h1>") and  
              "container" is the div with the id "app".  
              <br />
              The callback is optional, and we will not be making use of it this time.

              Let's add a new file called ".babelrc" and populate it with the following

              Hello world is great and all, but we want to turn this into a site that actually does something

              ## Setting up the files
              For our navigation bar, we want to create a directory under src called common (We will be following a DDD approach to file structure).  
              Then we'll add a file called "navbar.component.jsx"

              import React from 'react'
              import { NavLink } from 'react-router-dom'

          <section data-markdown>
            <script type="text/template">
              Inside those div's, we should setup our list of links as follows

              <div id="nav-bar">
                <ul className='nav-links'>

            <script type="text/template">
              Our file now looks like
              ```
              import React from 'react'
              import { NavLink } from 'react-router-dom'

              const NavBar = () =>

                      </li>
                      <li key='github'>
                          <NavLink to={'/github'} activeClassName='active'>Github</NavLink>
                      </li>
                  </ul>

            <script type="text/template">
              ```
              <NavLink to={'/'} activeClassName='active'>Home</NavLink>
              ```
              The main difference here from how a navigation header is normally constructed is the use  
              of the `<NavLink>` element rather than a standard `<a>`.  
              <br />
              The 'to' property is the relative link to the desired page. The above example links to the home page.  
              The 'activeClassName' property give the link element the class name when it is active. This can be used to style active or inactive links.  
              See the [docs](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/blob/master/packages/react-router-dom/docs/api/NavLink.md) for more information on the NavLink element.

              The exported NavBar can be used in our *main.js* file to be rendered to the page.  
              <br />
              Before we can do that though, we need to setup routing. This too can be done within *main.js*.  
              Add the following import to *main.js*
              ```
              import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom'
              ```
              Then within the `<Router>` element in the ReactDOM.render() method, setup our routing switch as follows
              ```
              ReactDOM.render(
                <Router>
                  <div>
                    <Switch>
                    </Switch>
                  </div>
                </Router>,
                appContainer
              )
              ```

              Within the `<Switch>` elements, we can define all our routes.  
              We don't really have any pages yet, but we need to setup as many routes as we have links, even if they are empty.  
              Add 2 routes like so
              ```
              <Switch>
                <Route path={'/'} component={null} exact />
                <Route path={'/github'} component={null} exact />
              </Switch>
              ```
              <br />
              We will leave the routes like this for now. Let's now include our NavBar.

          <section data-markdown>

              Still in *main.js*, import our NavBar component
              ```
              import NavBar from './common/navbar.component.jsx'
              ```
              Then add our NavBar to the render() method just above the `<Switch>`
              ```
              <Router>
                <NavBar />
                <Switch>

              Now we'll run into trouble here as the Router element can only have 1 child element.  
              We can fix this by wrapping our Navbar and Switch in a single div, leaving our render() method looking like
              ```
              ReactDOM.render(
                <Router>

                      <Route path={'/github'} component={null} exact />

              We're going to setup our hot reloading dev server so that we can develop and see our changes in real time!

              ## Configuration
              To begin our configuration, we'll need to revisit our *webpack.config.js* file.
              Add the following to loaders array
              ```
              {
                test: /\.jsx?$/,
                exclude: /node_modules/,
                loader: 'babel-loader'
              }
              ```
              This tells webpack to use babel to interpret jsx files, but to exclude our installed node modules.
            </script>
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            <script type="text/template">
              We'll also add a config entry to our loaders array to copy our static files to our dist folder
              ```
              {
                test: /\.html$/,
                loader: 'file-loader?name=[name].[ext]'
              }
              ```
              For our file loader to actually work though, we'll need to include the files we want in one of our compiled files.  
              Let's open up our *main.js* then add the following at the end of our imports
              ```
              import './index.html'
              ```
              It's important to note that the webpack 2 file loader does not automatically copy all files that match the
              test regex, but only those that are **also** included somewhere in the project.

          <section data-markdown>
            <script type="text/template">
              We then need to add our dev server config to the config object and define another entry point into our app (the hot reloader module)
              ```
              devServer: {
                inline: true, // Hot reloading
                port: 8081, // Port which the Dev Server will listen on
                contentBase: './src', // Where the entry to your app is
                open: true // Open site in new browser tab upon command execution
              }
              ```
              Insert into our entry array **AS THE FIRST ENTRY**
              ```
              'react-hot-loader/patch'
              ```
              This tells webpack to start a dependency graph at the hot loader module as well as one from our main.  
              More on this can be found [here](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/entry-points/)

               Let's also include a plugin which will make debugging much nicer
              ```
              plugins: [
                new webpack.NamedModulesPlugin()
              ]
              ```
              (the plugins array goes in the config object)  
              The Named Modules Plugin prints the module name and path instead of an internal ID when printing from a module.

              We still need to setup the hot module reloading in our *main.js* file.
              To do this, lets extract our ReactDOM.render() method into its own method, creatively named *render()*
              ```
              const render = () => {
